# Parallel Agent Platform — Docs Index

Docs are organized by **status**, not topic. Pick the bucket based on what you
need:

| Bucket                                   | What's in it                               | When to read                                                                     |
| ---------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| [`active/`](active/)                     | In-flight scoping docs and PR plans        | Starting work on a PR — find the scoping doc and treat it as the source of truth |
| [`reference/`](reference/)               | Durable design docs, conventions, runbooks | Looking up how something is designed, named, or run                              |
| [`shipped/`](shipped/)                   | PR plans whose work has merged             | Historical context only — these may be stale                                     |
| [`superseded/`](superseded/)             | Replaced by a newer doc                    | Don't act on these; follow the pointer at the top                                |
| [`decision-records/`](decision-records/) | ADRs for code organization                 | Numbered, append-only                                                            |
| [`open-questions/`](open-questions/)     | Open product/architecture questions        | When a decision is still being framed                                            |

## Workflow

1. Starting a PR? Check `active/` first. If a scoping doc exists, **address it
   in your PR** — update the doc as the design clarifies, and link it from the
   PR description.
2. No doc exists for a non-trivial change? Write a short one in `active/`
   before opening the PR.
3. PR(s) merged? Move the doc to `shipped/` (`git mv docs/active/foo.md
docs/shipped/`) and remove its bullet from the **Active** section below.
4. Replacing an older doc? Move the older one to `superseded/` and add a
   one-line pointer to its replacement at the top.

  — Promote `execution_target` to a first-class DB column.
- [active/fleet-sampling-observer-scope.md](active/fleet-sampling-observer-scope.md)
  — Always-on learning loop: on a slow tick, sample one running agent
  (rotating across the fleet), read a ~10-message slice of its most
  recent run, and emit an advisory recommendation the planning/manager
  agent consumes. Builds on learning-sidecar + closed-loop-observability;
  advisory only, no routing-rule writes.
- [active/frontend-supabase-api-refactor-pr-plan.md](active/frontend-supabase-api-refactor-pr-plan.md)

  PR-gated skill distillation on top of the existing `memory_items` table.
- [active/learning-sidecar-pr-plan.md](active/learning-sidecar-pr-plan.md)
  — PR-by-PR sequence for the learning sidecar across harper-server,

  scheduler/work-item/cron tables, propose scheduled-work materialization, and
  outline platform/runtime PRs.
- [active/manager-pr-review-fallback-scope.md](active/manager-pr-review-fallback-scope.md)
  — Scope the manager-agent PR review fallback: detect existing GitHub
  auto-review, avoid duplicate reviews per PR head SHA, and dispatch a
  cross-model reviewer only when review is missing.

  — Quarantine legacy direct local-chat helper behavior from the current relay
  helper architecture.
