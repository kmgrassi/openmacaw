# OpenMacaw

OpenMacaw is an open-source platform for coordinating AI agents across hosted
and local runtimes. This repository combines the web/API platform, the runtime
orchestrator, and the installable local helper into one source tree.

> OpenMacaw is pre-release. It works for local development and self-hosting
> experiments, but naming, docs, and packaging are still being cleaned up for
> a polished public launch — see [Project status](#project-status).

## Quick start

### Prerequisites

| Tool | Used by | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Git | everything | |
| Node.js 20+ and [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) 9+ | platform, runtime scripts | `npm install -g pnpm` |
| Elixir 1.16+ / Erlang OTP 26+ (`elixir`, `mix`) | runtime | `brew install elixir` or [mise](https://mise.jdx.dev/) |
| `curl`, `lsof`, `shasum` | dev scripts | preinstalled on macOS; standard packages on Linux |
| Docker + [Supabase CLI](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/local-development) | local database | only if you run Supabase locally (recommended) |
| Go 1.23+ | local runtime helper | only if you build the optional helper daemon |

Verify the command-line tools with:

```sh
./openmacaw doctor
```

### 1. Set up the database (Supabase)

OpenMacaw stores its state in [Supabase](https://supabase.com) (Postgres).
The fastest path is the local stack:

```sh
cd platform
supabase start      # starts local Postgres + auth + Studio (needs Docker)
supabase db reset   # applies the schema from supabase/migrations/
supabase status     # prints the URL and keys you need in the next step
```

Alternatively, create a hosted Supabase project and push the schema to it —
see [docs/supabase/README.md](docs/supabase/README.md) for both paths in
detail.

### 2. Configure environment

Copy the example env files and fill in the **Required** sections at the top
with the values from `supabase status` (or your hosted project's dashboard):

```sh
cp platform/.env.example platform/.env
cp runtime/.env.example runtime/.env
```

In `platform/.env`, four values must be set for the stack to boot and log in:
`SUPABASE_URL`, `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`, `VITE_SUPABASE_DEV_URL`, and
`VITE_SUPABASE_DEV_ANON_KEY`. The runtime needs the same `SUPABASE_URL` and
`SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` pair. Everything else in the files is optional
and feature-gated.

### 3. Run the stack

From the repository root:

```sh
./openmacaw run
```

That command checks prerequisites and your env file, installs missing
JavaScript and Elixir dependencies, then starts the platform API, platform web
app, runtime launcher, and runtime orchestrator together:

- Web: `http://127.0.0.1:5173`
- API: `http://127.0.0.1:3100`
- Runtime orchestrator: `http://127.0.0.1:4000`
- Runtime launcher: `http://127.0.0.1:4100`

Press `Ctrl+C` to stop the stack.

### 4. Log in and verify

Create a user, then sign in at `http://127.0.0.1:5173`:

- **Local Supabase:** open Supabase Studio (`http://127.0.0.1:54323`),
  go to **Authentication → Users → Add user**, and create an email/password
  user.
- **Hosted Supabase:** create the user from the project dashboard's
  Authentication page.

Optionally set `VITE_DEV_LOGIN_EMAIL` / `VITE_DEV_LOGIN_PASSWORD` in
`platform/.env` to get a one-click "Use dev credentials" button on the login
page (development builds only).

For a step-by-step first-run checklist — login, onboarding, sending a first
agent message — follow the
[end-to-end local runbook](platform/docs/reference/end-to-end-local-runbook.md).

### Everyday commands

```sh
./openmacaw doctor   # check prerequisites and env configuration
./openmacaw status   # show local service health
./openmacaw stop     # stop a stack started by ./openmacaw run
```

Linked git worktrees automatically use an offset port range so multiple agents
can run OpenMacaw side by side. Override ports with `API_PORT`, `WEB_PORT`,
`ORCHESTRATOR_PORT`, `LAUNCHER_PORT`, or `LAUNCHER_START_PORT` when needed.

## What is in this repo

- `platform/` contains the web app, API gateway, shared contracts, platform
  scripts, and generated Supabase types.
- `runtime/` contains the Elixir runtime/orchestrator, launcher, relay-facing
  runtime behavior, worker bridge, smoke tools, and generated runtime schema
  artifacts.
- `local-runtime-helper/` contains the Go daemon that connects a user's machine
  to supported local runners and the runtime relay.
- `docs/` contains OpenMacaw-level planning and reference material that applies
  across the imported subsystems.

## How the pieces fit together

At a high level:

1. The platform provides the browser UI, API surface, shared contracts, and
   database-backed coordination layer.
2. The runtime launches and supervises agent work, reads routable work items,
   runs manager/planner flows, and exposes launcher/worker bridge APIs.
3. The local runtime helper runs on a user's machine, opens an outbound relay
   connection, advertises configured local runners, and can execute supported
   local workflows without requiring inbound network access.

The local runtime helper is a separate daemon for workflows that need local
model or local tool execution (Ollama, OpenClaw, and other local runners).
Set it up from [`local-runtime-helper/`](local-runtime-helper/README.md) after
the core stack is running.

## Project status

OpenMacaw was imported from separate internal projects and is being prepared
for a public launch. Some subsystem docs still carry pre-import naming and
internal references; treat those as cleanup targets, not the final public
position. See
[docs/open-source-readiness-scope.md](docs/open-source-readiness-scope.md) for
the readiness plan and remaining work.
